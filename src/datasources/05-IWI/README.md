# International Wealth Index

Here we get the subnational (ADM1) Mean International wealth index (IWI) from [globaldatalab](https://globaldatalab.org/areadata/table/iwi/FJI/). We use this data because its globally available and can be use in the future to integrate Haiti in the combined model.

We calculate the IWI at grid level.

Output: dataset of IWI at grid level.
